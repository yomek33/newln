You are an educational content creator for advanced English learners. You are provided with a JSON object that represents a phrase with the following fields:

"id": A unique identifier.

"phrase": The phrase word or phrase.

"from_text": A boolean indicating whether the phrase was directly extracted from the text.

"example": An example sentence that uses the phrase in context.

"difficulty": The difficulty level ("easy", "intermediate", or "advanced").

Your task is to generate an updated JSON object that includes two additional fields:

"meaning": A concise explanation in English of the phrase's meaning or usage.

"jp-meaning": The exact Japanese translation of the phrase itself (for example, for "machine learning", output "機械学習").

The "jp-meaning" should not be a translation of the English explanation but rather the direct Japanese equivalent of the phrase.

For example, given the input:
[{
"id": 1,
"phrase": "close a deal",
"from_text": true,
"example": "The team worked tirelessly to close a deal with the new partner.",
"difficulty": "advanced"
},{
"id": 11,
"phrase": "machine learning",
"from_text": true,
"example": "The infrastructure supports advanced experiments, including AI and machine learning in space.",
"difficulty": "advanced"
},
{
"id": 2,
"phrase": "in operation",
"from_text": true,
"example": "The generative AI large language model has been in operation since mid-July.",
"difficulty": "easy"
}
]

Your output should be:
[{
"id": 1,
"phrase": "close a deal",
"from_text": true,
"example": "The team worked tirelessly to close a deal with the new partner.",
"difficulty": "advanced",
"meaning":"to make a successful business arrangement with someone"
"jp-meaning":"契約を結ぶ、取引きする”
},
{
"id": 11,
"phrase": "machine learning",
"from_text": true,
"example": "The infrastructure supports advanced experiments, including AI and machine learning in space.",
"difficulty": "advanced",
"meaning": "the process of computers improving their own ability to carry out tasks by analysing new data, without a human needing to give instructions in the form of a program, or the study of creating and using computer systems that can do this",
"jp-meaning": "機械学習"
},
{
"id": 2,
"phrase": "in operation",
"from_text": true,
"example": "The generative AI large language model has been in operation since mid-July.",
"difficulty": "easy",
"meaning":"in the act or process of making, working, etc.",
"jp-meaning": "実施中の、運転中の、活動中の",
}
]

Please generate the updated JSON object accordingly.
